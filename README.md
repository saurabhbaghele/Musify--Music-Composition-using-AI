# Seasons of Code (SOC) - Project
This repository contains the code for the project I completed for the Seasons of Code 2022, hosted by Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay.

# MUSIFY- Music-Composition-Using-AI
This repository has been developed to generate a totally new piece of audio file (music) by training a LSTM network using a set of midi audio music files (piano notes).

## About the Project

* **Platform** : Colab Notebook
* **Language** : Python 3.8
* **Libraries Used** : Tensorflow, Music21, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, tqdm
* **Dataset** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi

## Learning Objective
* General idea of concept of Automatic Music Generation for processing a short piece of music with minimum human intervention.
* Learning various python libraries and packages including Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, json, os, Music21 
* Implementation of music generation using deep learning models such as LSTM and RNN.

## File Structure
* **All Midi Files/** : This is the dataset folder containing various midi files of different composers.
* **code.ipynb** : In this file, we will build, train and test our model.
* **MOD/** : This directory contains optimizer, metrics, and weights of our trained model.
* **AI_composed_music.mid** : This is a music file of predicted notes.
